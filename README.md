Full-Stack .NET 8/9 Web API Auth PostgreSQL JWT Rolebased

This project is a modular, maintainable, and scalable backend implementation for a learning platform. Built with modern .NET 8/9 features, it showcases best practices such as the Generic Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, Role-Based Authentication, JWT-based security, and a clean multi-layered architecture.

🛠️ Key Features
✅ Generic Repository Pattern - A reusable, flexible design pattern implementation for clean database access.

✅ Dependency Injection - Fully implemented for modular design and testability.

✅ Authentication & Authorization - Secure login & user management with JWT-based authentication.

✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Users have roles (Admin, User, etc.), enabling fine-grained permissions.

✅ Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL - A robust, efficient ORM paired with PostgreSQL for database management.

✅ Token Security with JWT - Secure token generation with expiration and role claims.

✅ PostgreSQL Database - Optimized relational database management for production-ready data persistence.

✅ Modern .NET 8/9 Features - Leverage the latest C# versions & .NET best practices for improved performance and maintainability.

📚 Tech Stack
Backend:

.NET 8/9
Entity Framework Core
PostgreSQL
